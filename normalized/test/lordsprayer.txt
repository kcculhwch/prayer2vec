our father who art in heaven
  hollowed be thy name
thy kindgdom come
  thy will be done
  on earth as in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses
  as we forgive those who trespass against us
lead us not into temptation
  but deliver us from evil
for thie is the kingdom and power
  and the glory forever and forever
