Our Father, who art in heaven,
  hollowed be thy name.
Thy kindgdom come,
  thy will be done,
  on earth as in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses
  as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation,
  but deliver us from evil
For thie is the kingdom and power
  and the glory forever and forever.
